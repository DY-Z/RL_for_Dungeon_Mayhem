# RL for Dungeon Mayhem

In this project, we trained agents who can play Dungeon Mayhem, a famous card game, through reinforcement learning. The rules of the game can be found through one single Google search.

The models we tried are Deep Monte Carlo and DQN. The results showed that Deep Monte Carlo outperformed DQN. And its performance may get even better if we train it for more episodes.

We also examined the impact of pre-training. It turns out that pre-training with a carefully chosen heuristic function can improve the performance of both DMC and DQN.
